# Telegram UX

## Run Chronology

Foreign GUI/CLI runs render as:

```text
New run
[User]
[commentary]
[Tool]
[Output]
[Final]
```

`New run`, `[commentary]`, `[Tool]`, and `[Output]` are deleted best-effort when the final card is rendered. `[User]` remains as a historical marker.

`New run` identifies the source of the run. `[User]` carries the request text. Neither card shows run status.

## Final Card

The active commentary card owns run status while the run is active. When the final answer is available, the bridge sends a new `[Final]` card and moves the panel route to that message. `[Final]` shows final-answer text/status only; completed commentary and tool/output history stay in Details. Tool-only turns with no commentary appear in Details as `Tool activity`. Details pagination edits the Final card instead of sending more messages, and Details/Back buttons stay bound to the completed run card that created them.

## Notifications

Most bot messages are sent silently to avoid notification spam. Normal Telegram notifications are reserved for `New run`, `[Plan]`, and `[Final]`. `New run` notifications are enabled by default and can be disabled with `CTR_GO_NOTIFY_NEW_RUN=off`; the card remains visible either way. `[Plan]` question cards and `[Final]` cards always use normal notifications.

## Plan Mode

Telegram can start a Codex Plan Mode turn with `/plan <thread> <text>`, `/plan_mode <thread> <text>`, or `/reply --plan <thread> <text>`. These commands use App Server `turn/start` with `collaborationMode.mode = plan`; prompt wording alone is not treated as Plan Mode.

If a thread remains in Plan Mode after a completed turn, the Plan Final Card shows `Turn off Plan`. Pressing it sets a one-shot local reset for that thread; the next ordinary `turn/start` is sent with `collaborationMode.mode = default` and then the reset is cleared. `/stop <thread>` sets the same one-shot reset even when the thread is already idle.

When Codex asks for input, the bridge renders a separate routeable `[Plan]` prompt-card. Replying to that card answers the same run. Structured buttons appear only when Codex provides choices.

Plan answer buttons are scoped to their own turn. A pending Plan prompt from an
older turn must not appear under a newer `[commentary]` card for the same
thread.

## New Threads

`/projects` opens a project/workspace menu from cached Codex thread metadata.
The `New thread` action arms the current chat/topic so the next plain-text
message creates a new App Server thread in that project cwd and starts the first
turn with that text.

Cached threads whose cwd is under `Documents/Codex` or the configured
`CTR_GO_CODEX_CHATS_ROOT` are treated as Codex UI `Chats`, not normal projects.
The main `/projects` view shows recent project workspaces and the latest Chat
previews; `Open Chats` opens the full paginated Chat list. Selecting a Chat
opens and binds that single thread.

New Chat starts use `/newchat <prompt>`. The bridge creates a dated Chat folder
under the configured Chats root, passes that cwd to App Server `thread/start`,
and starts the first turn in that cwd. Project-scoped new threads are created
only through a project's `New thread` action.

The Telegram bot does not accept arbitrary filesystem paths for this flow.
Creating or editing project work directories is a separate future feature.

## Codex Settings

`/settings`, `/model`, and `/effort` expose Telegram button menus for model selection and reasoning effort used by Telegram-started collaboration-mode turns. The selections are stored in SQLite daemon state and are not configured through public env vars.

After a model or reasoning-effort selection, the menu message is edited into a compact settings summary without inline choice buttons. Use `/settings`, `/model`, or `/effort` to reopen the menus.

## Exports

- `Tools file`: on-demand file for selected Details tool/output.
- `Get full log`: on-demand archive from Codex session JSONL.

Automatic tool-output document spam is intentionally forbidden.
