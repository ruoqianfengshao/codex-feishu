## Core Idea

Keep Codex local, but make its threads observable and controllable through
stable private adapters.

The daemon currently owns chat adapter connectivity, Codex App Server
connectivity, SQLite state, observer polling, and route/callback handling. The
v0.5 direction extracts the Codex control layer so future router agents, voice
assistants, and local APIs can reuse it without copying adapter-specific
behavior.
