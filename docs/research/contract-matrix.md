# Contract Matrix

Python oracle: `..\codex-telegram-remote`

This file now serves two purposes:

- baseline behavior imported from the Python oracle
- target Telegram observer/UI v2 deltas that the Go runtime is expected to adopt
- v0.5 Codex Control Plane contracts that future adapters should consume

## Commands

- `/start`
- `/help`
- `/threads`
- `/projects`
- `/show <thread>`
- `/bind <thread>`
- `/reply [--plan] <thread> <text>`
- `/plan <thread> <text>`
- `/plan <text>`
- `/plan_mode <thread> <text>`
- `/plan_mode <text>`
- `/settings`
- `/model`
- `/effort`
- `/new <project-key-or-number> <prompt>`
- `/newchat <prompt>`
- `/newthread <prompt>`
- `/context`
- `/whereami`
- `/observe all|off`
- `/status`
- `/repair`
- `/stop [thread]`
- `/approve <request_id>`
- `/deny <request_id>`

## Aliases and adjacent commands

- `/whereami` is an alias of `/context`
- `/models` is an alias of `/model`
- `/reasoning` and `/reasoning_effort` are aliases of `/effort`
- `/codex_settings` is an alias of `/settings`
- `/away` and `/back` exist in the Python product surface but are not part of the minimal Go cutover slice yet

## Local configuration and distribution

- `ctr-go init` creates a private local config file at `~/.codex-tg/config.env` by default.
- `ctr-go service install` is the macOS service-first setup path; it can prompt
  interactively or receive all important values through flags.
- macOS service lifecycle commands are `ctr-go service start|stop|restart|status|enable-login|disable-login|uninstall`.
- `CTR_GO_CONFIG` points at an alternate config file.
- Config precedence is explicit environment variables, then config file values, then built-in defaults.
- Config files use simple `.env` style `KEY=VALUE` entries; comments and quoted values are supported, but shell expansion is not.
- Runtime proxy env can be stored in the private config and applied after
  startup; LaunchAgent plists still carry only `CTR_GO_CONFIG`.
- `status`, `doctor`, daemon logs, init summaries, service summaries, LaunchAgent plists, and tray surfaces must not print Telegram bot tokens or Feishu app secrets in full.
- Official GitHub Release assets include `ctr-go` archives for macOS, Linux, and Windows, macOS `.pkg` artifacts, and `SHA256SUMS`.

## Codex Control API Contract

The first implementation target is internal Go interfaces, not a public HTTP
API. Future router-agent or voice adapters may consume the same contract through
a local loopback or unix-socket API after a separate ADR.

Thread lifecycle:

- list and search threads, including cwd-scoped queries when App Server supports them
- read a thread with or without full turns
- start, resume, fork, rename, archive, unarchive, compact, and rollback threads
- keep `thread_id` as the durable identity across every adapter
- detect unavailable App Server capabilities instead of assuming every method exists

Turn lifecycle:

- start a turn with text input and optional model, reasoning, cwd, approval, sandbox, and collaboration-mode settings
- steer an active turn only when the expected turn id matches
- interrupt an active turn by `thread_id + turn_id`
- answer user-input requests and approval requests through the originating App Server request id
- preserve existing stale-active recovery rules before falling back to a new `turn/start`

Event subscription:

- normalize App Server lifecycle, tool, final, approval, and input events before adapters see them
- treat `thread/read` snapshots as durable reconciliation state
- keep App Server live events as the only live tool/output/final source; session JSONL remains export-only
- expose enough ids for adapters to route replies, approvals, Details, and notifications safely

Skills and ecosystem:

- list available Codex skills by cwd when supported
- read plugin skill metadata when supported
- inspect MCP server status, app list, hooks list, and config state when supported
- prefer Codex-native Skills, Hooks, and Automations over duplicate custom formats

Notifications:

- classify normalized events as `urgent`, `normal`, `silent`, or `digest`
- urgent examples: approval needed, user input needed, run failed, security/sandbox denial
- normal examples: final answer, high-value run start when enabled by adapter policy
- silent examples: progress deltas, tool output deltas, menu/callback responses
- digest examples: low-priority automation summaries or scheduled findings

Adapter routing:

- adapters must not own Codex identity
- Telegram message ids, voice sessions, tray actions, and future HTTP requests are adapter context
- control-core operations route by durable Codex ids and explicit adapter-supplied intent

## Telegram Adapter Contract

- Global observer monitoring is default-on when an operator target can be resolved automatically.
- `/observe all` moves the single global observer target to the current chat/topic.
- `/observe off` disables global background monitoring.
- The observer target model is no longer additive `main DM + extra feeds`.
- The observer surface is centered around a summary panel keyed by `(chat, project, thread)`.
- The summary panel owns `Stop` and `Steer`.
- Tool/output stream messages do not carry buttons.
- Final answers are delivered separately and expose `Получить полный лог`.
- Telegram sends normal notifications only for `New run` (configurable through `CTR_GO_NOTIFY_NEW_RUN`), `[Plan]` prompt-cards, and `[Final]`; other bot messages are silent.
- Plan Mode / waiting-input states create a separate routeable `[Plan]` prompt-card.
- `[Plan]` buttons are structured-only: they come from Codex `choices/options/suggestions/responses`, never from bridge heuristics.
- Telegram-originated Plan Mode starts use App Server `turn/start` with `collaborationMode.mode = plan`; prompt wording alone is not Plan Mode.
- If a thread remains in Plan Mode, `Turn off Plan` on the Plan Final Card and `/stop <thread>` set a one-shot local reset; the next ordinary Telegram-originated `turn/start` for that thread uses `collaborationMode.mode = default` and then clears the reset.
- `/model` and `/effort` are button menus backed by SQLite daemon state for Telegram-started collaboration-mode model settings.
- After a model or reasoning-effort selection, the edited settings message removes inline choice buttons.
- `/projects` groups cached non-Chat projects by normalized `cwd`, sorts projects by latest cached thread activity, shows latest Codex UI Chat previews, opens full Chats pagination through `Open Chats`, and never accepts arbitrary filesystem paths from Telegram.
- `/projects` buttons show meaningful labels (`N. Project name`, `Chat N. Thread name`); internal project keys are not rendered in the menu, and project rows show `last thread:`.
- Cached threads under generic `Documents/Codex` paths or the configured `CTR_GO_CODEX_CHATS_ROOT` are treated as single-thread `Chats`; selecting a Chat opens and binds that thread and does not offer project `New thread`.
- `New thread` creates a one-shot state; the next plain-text message starts a new App Server thread in the selected project cwd and uses that text as the first prompt.
- `/newchat <prompt>` creates a dated Chat folder under the configured Chats root, calls App Server `thread/start` with that cwd, and uses the prompt as the first turn.
- `/newthread <prompt>` starts a new App Server thread without a Telegram-selected cwd parameter and uses the prompt as the first turn. It must not create a Chat folder; App Server may still attach the daemon default cwd.
- `/plan <text>` and `/plan_mode <text>` use reply route, armed state, or current binding when the first token is not a known or UUID-like thread id.
- Synthetic polling prompts without `request_id` are answered with `turn/steer`, then `turn/start` if the turn is already unavailable.
- Replies to active turns steer the active turn. If steering is rejected while the thread still looks genuinely active, the bridge must not create a parallel `turn/start`; stale-active errors such as `no active turn to steer` are handled by ADR-012 and may fall back to a new `turn/start` after re-read.
- All observer/card messages carry a visual identity header: `emoji [Project] [Thread] [T:thread] [R:run] [Kind]`.
- Emoji markers are stable visual hints; route correctness remains based on DB message routes and callback tokens.
- Full `thread_id` and `turn_id` are exposed through `/context` and the `Get thread id` summary/Final action; compact `T:`/`R:` chips are not routing authority.
- Foreign GUI/CLI runs create separate `New run` and `[User]` cards before the live trio.
- If the prompt is not available when the run is discovered, `[User]` starts as a placeholder and is edited into the real prompt later.
- Telegram-originated runs create `New run` and the live trio, but do not duplicate the user request as `[User]`.
- Telegram-visible text must never render literal `"<nil>"`. Missing, null, empty, or nil-like App Server fields are treated as absent and must be cleaned before Markdown/entity conversion.

## Feishu/Lark Adapter Contract

- Feishu/Lark uses an enterprise self-built app and the official SDK WebSocket
  long connection; no public callback URL is required for message receive or
  card action events.
- `CTR_GO_ADAPTER=feishu` selects the Feishu/Lark adapter. `auto` selects it
  when `CTR_GO_FEISHU_APP_ID` and `CTR_GO_FEISHU_APP_SECRET` are present.
- Feishu `chat_id`, `open_id`, and `message_id` are mapped into stable local
  numeric ids before they enter the Codex control core. The original Feishu ids
  remain adapter context and are persisted only for send/edit/delete routing.
- Text messages are accepted from `im.message.receive_v1`; non-text messages
  are ignored by the control path.
- Feishu input-box shortcuts are the platform's bot custom menu, not the
  Telegram-style command registry. The menu is configured in the Feishu
  developer console, is limited to one-on-one bot chats, and requires publishing
  a new app version before it appears. Menu items should usually use the "send
  text message" action with existing commands such as `/help`, `/threads`,
  `/projects`, `/settings`, `/status`, or `/repair`.
- Event-based bot menu items use `application.bot.menu_v6`. Supported event
  keys include `help`, `threads`, `projects`, `settings`, `status`,
  `observe_all`, `observe_off`, and `repair`. Because Feishu menu events do not
  include a chat id, event responses are sent to the operator's bot DM.
- Replies use Feishu parent/root message ids when available, then fall back to
  the current binding rules already owned by the daemon.
- Outbound plain text uses Feishu text messages. Messages with buttons use
  interactive cards, with callback tokens stored under button value
  `callback_data`.
- Card callbacks map `open_message_id`, `open_chat_id`, and operator `open_id`
  back to local numeric ids before calling the daemon callback handler.
- Edits patch interactive cards when buttons are present and update text
  messages otherwise. Deletes use the stored Feishu open message id.
- File exports upload a Feishu file and then send it to the mapped chat, with
  an optional caption sent as a separate text message.
- Feishu allowlists can use `CTR_GO_FEISHU_ALLOWED_OPEN_IDS` and
  `CTR_GO_FEISHU_ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS`. Existing numeric allowlists
  `CTR_GO_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` and `CTR_GO_ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS` still apply after id
  mapping when configured.
- Feishu-visible text must never render literal `"<nil>"`. Missing, null,
  empty, or nil-like App Server fields are treated as absent before rendering.

## Callback / button surface from the oracle

Navigation/edit-in-place callbacks:

- `nav_projects`
- `nav_all_chats`
- `nav_active`
- `nav_threads_page`
- `nav_projects_page`
- `nav_project_threads_page`
- `pick_project`
- `show_thread`
- `show_context`

State-changing callbacks:

- `bind_here`
- `follow_here`
- `observe_all`
- `reply_hint`
- `stop_turn`
- `approve`
- `approve_session`
- `deny`
- `cancel`

Target v2 callback surface:

- `show_thread`
- `bind_here`
- `stop_turn`
- `steer_turn`
- `get_full_log`
- `answer_choice`
- `observe_all`
- `observe_off`
- `settings_overview`
- `settings_model_menu`
- `settings_reasoning_menu`
- `settings_model_set`
- `settings_reasoning_set`
- `get_thread_id`
- `turn_off_plan`

## Routing precedence

From Python tests and router behavior:

1. explicit thread id from command
2. reply-to Telegram message route
3. current thread binding

Additional route rules:

- `/show` and `/bind` without an explicit thread id must resolve reply-route first
- route precedence stays unchanged even after the observer/UI v2 changes
- target v2 no longer assumes a dedicated read-only observer-only chat
- free-text routing still needs an unambiguous target even if the current chat also receives global observer panels
- reply-to `[Plan]` routes before binding and carries `thread_id`, `turn_id`, and `request_id` when available
- real `request_id` Plan answers use App Server server-request response; synthetic Plan answers use `turn/steer`
- `/reply --plan`, `/plan`, and `/plan_mode` carry an explicit Plan Mode start intent when they create a new turn
- Hidden `/reply --default` and `/default` fallback paths may still carry an explicit Default Mode start intent, but they are not advertised in the public command menu.
- `Turn off Plan` and `/stop` carry a one-shot Default Mode reset intent for the next ordinary turn, not for the current callback/stop action itself.

## Observer targets

- Oracle baseline:
  - implicit main DM when exactly one allowed user exists
  - explicit observer targets from `/observe all`
  - explicit observer targets do not replace the implicit main DM
- Target v2:
  - one global observer target
  - default-on when the target can be resolved automatically
  - `/observe all` moves the target
  - `/observe off` disables monitoring

## Minimal observer event kinds

- `turn_started`
- `tool_activity`
- `thread_updated`
- `final_answer`
- `turn_completed`
- `turn_failed`

Observer/UI v2 presentation contract:

- run notice:
  - appears before `[User]` and summary/tool/output for new runs
  - carries source markers, source mode, and route metadata, but not run status
  - is deleted best-effort after finalization
  - uses normal Telegram notification only when `CTR_GO_NOTIFY_NEW_RUN` is enabled
- user notice:
  - appears after `New run` for GUI/CLI runs and before summary/tool/output
  - remains after finalization as the historical request marker
  - may start as a placeholder and edit into the actual prompt
- summary-panel update:
  - carries project/thread source markers
  - owns live run status while active
  - carries action buttons such as `Stop` and `Steer`
  - is sent silently and deleted best-effort after finalization
- tool/output message:
  - carries source markers
  - carries no buttons
  - is deleted best-effort after finalization
- final-answer message:
  - carries source markers
  - carries on-demand `Получить полный лог`
  - is sent as a new message with a normal Telegram notification
  - becomes the panel summary message id for Details/Back callbacks
  - contains final answer/status without replaying completed commentary/tool/output transcript
  - exposes completed tool-only turns through Details as `Tool activity`

Minimal event payload expected by the Telegram layer:

- `event_id`
- `kind`
- `thread_id`
- `project_name`
- `thread_title`
- `text`

Optional event payload fields:

- `status`
- `turn_id`
- `item_id`
- `request_id`
- `needs_reply`
- `needs_approval`

Plan prompt payload fields:

- `prompt_id`
- `source`
- `thread_id`
- `turn_id`
- `item_id`
- `request_id`
- `question`
- `options`
- `fingerprint`

## Acceptance scenarios

- global observer is active by default when one operator target exists
- `/observe all` moves the observer target to the current chat/topic
- `/observe off` disables global monitoring
- `/status` must show readiness, transport, queue, tracked thread count, and current routing
- `/context` must describe the active tuple of chat/project/thread or the lack of one
- polling fallback must emit progress/final/completion for foreign threads
- stale live-only assumptions must not suppress polling fallback
- repair must recreate app-server sessions and resume tracked threads without manual route surgery
- observer delivery must remain durable across daemon restart
- summary panels must be stable per `(chat, project, thread)` instead of spamming a new actionable message for every event
- waiting Plan prompts must be visible as `[Plan]` messages and answerable by Telegram Reply
- Plan answer buttons must stay scoped to their Plan turn; a stale pending input from an older turn must not be attached to a newer `[commentary]` card
- late foreign `[User]` prompts must edit the existing placeholder, not append below live trio messages
- duplicate live+poll sync must not create multiple `[Plan]` cards for the same prompt fingerprint
